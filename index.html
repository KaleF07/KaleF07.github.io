        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Recent graduate from the University of Calgary with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Digital Engineering. 
            I am passionate about driving innovation in our daily lives through advancing technology. With a hands-on approach and a knack for quick learning, 
            I thrive on creating impactful projects that blend cutting-edge ideas with practical implementation. My expertise extends from hardware engineering, 
            machine learning and project management, reflecting a commitment to staying ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of emerging technologies. <br><br>

            During my time in university, I have developed a passion for computer systems and embedded engineering, taking a deep dive into the various applications 
            in which it is used. I am excited to connect with indsutry professionals and explore various opportunities to expand my knowledge in computer systems and 
            advancing AI technology. <br><br>

            I am currently seeking a full-time position in the field of Electrical Engineering, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to drive innovation and learn from industry experts.

            <h3>Bachelors of Science, Major in Electrical Engineering, Minor in Digital Engineering</h3>
            <h4>University of Calgary (September 2019 - May 2024)</h4>
            <p>During my time in University, I had the opportunity to work on many projects that strengthened my understanding of Electrical Engineering and Embedded Systems.
                A few of the projects I worked on include: <br><br>
                ENCM 515, Application-Specific Processors and Accelerators: <br>
                - Using development board with ARM Cortex-M4 microprocessor, developed an algorithm in C code that applies an image 
                    filter kernel to a series of RGB images stored as a 2D array in the microcontroller’s memory <br>
                - Using commonly used optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, block processing and special MAC assembly 
                    instructions, optimized the algorithm to ensure the images can be processed in real-time <br>
                - Introduced proper data retrieval methods for images from the microcontroller’s memory into registers <br> <br>

                Canopy: Wireless Measurement Network: <br>
                - Designed a fully autonomous wireless measurement network used for data collection of trees planted by our sponsor Karbon-X <br>
                -  Fully designed PCB using KiCAD that includes device’s power management system, microcontroller and peripherals needed for operation <br>
                -  Assisted in developing firmware for the communication protocol used by each node using Sub-IoT, an open source stack for DASH 7 Alliance Protocol <br> <br>

                Autonomous Alert: Siren Detection using Machine Learning <br>
                -  Device based off Raspberry Pi that uses a machine learning algorithm using fastai python library to accurately predict 
                ambulance sirens and alert the driver in real-time <br>
                -  Trained and validated Neural Network model using spectrograms to detect siren with up to 97% accuracy <br>
